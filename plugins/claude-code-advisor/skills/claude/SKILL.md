# Claude Code Advisor

Use this skill to route Codex work to the local Claude Code CLI through the
bundled companion runtime. Codex remains the orchestrator. Claude Code is the
advisor, checker, or reviewer.

## Invocation Contract

Canonical forms:

```text
$claude setup
$claude advise <question>
$claude do [--background] [--write] [--model sonnet|opus] <prepared task>
$claude rescue [--background] [--write] [--resume] <task>
$claude review [--base <ref>]
$claude adversarial-review [--base <ref>] [focus]
$claude monitor [job-id]
$claude status [job-id]
$claude result [job-id]
$claude cancel [job-id]
$claude resume-candidate
```

If Codex passes slash-style text through to this skill, normalize it before
routing:

```text
/claude <subcommand> <args> -> $claude <subcommand> <args>
/claude:setup -> $claude setup
/claude:advise <question> -> $claude advise <question>
/claude:do <prepared task> -> $claude do <prepared task>
/claude:rescue <task> -> $claude rescue <task>
/claude:review [--base <ref>] -> $claude review [--base <ref>]
/claude:adversarial-review [focus] -> $claude adversarial-review [focus]
/claude:monitor [job-id] -> $claude monitor [job-id]
/claude:status [job-id] -> $claude status [job-id]
/claude:result [job-id] -> $claude result [job-id]
/claude:cancel [job-id] -> $claude cancel [job-id]
```

Do not add or depend on undocumented plugin manifest fields for custom slash
commands. The guaranteed Codex surface is the `$claude` skill mention.

## Hard Rules

- Always call the bundled companion at `<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs`
  using an absolute path. The plugin root is the `claude-code-advisor`
  directory that contains `.codex-plugin/`, `skills/`, and `scripts/`.
- Do not call `claude` directly from the skill instructions.
- Return a concise human summary unless the user asks for raw JSON.
- Review and adversarial-review are read-only.
- Write-capable Claude work requires explicit `--write`.
- Do not pass `--model sonnet` for advice, review, adversarial-review, rescue,
  or monitor work unless the user explicitly asks for Sonnet. Let Claude Code
  use the user's configured default model.
- Pass `--effort xhigh` for advice, review, adversarial-review, rescue, and
  background jobs unless the user explicitly asks for another effort.
- Sonnet is reserved for explicit junior-agent delegation governed by the
  `tasks-for-sonnet` skill. Never send Sonnet a vague task.
- Before `$claude do --model sonnet`, load `tasks-for-sonnet` and prepare the
  task from that skill. The prompt must include the role, absolute paths or a
  pinned commit, a word cap, "What Must Be True", "Known Constraints", and
  "Mechanical Verification".
- Use `$claude do --model opus` for complex/high-judgment Claude tasks when the
  user asks for or agrees to a stronger Claude worker. Treat Opus as the
  Claude-side choice for tasks you would not hand to a junior agent.
- Do not auto-resume a Claude job when the companion says explicit selection
  is required.

## Routing

- `setup`: run the companion setup command and show the result.
- `advise`: use for architecture questions, second opinions, and checker work.
  Use `--background` for substantive prompts, large context, or anything likely
  to need more than one short answer.
- `do`: use only for a specific prepared task. This is the preferred route when
  the user asks Claude to do coding, exploration, scout, verifier, reviewer, or
  synthesis work. For Sonnet, first apply `tasks-for-sonnet`; then route the
  prepared task through `do`. For complex/high-judgment tasks, use Opus or the
  user's configured default powerful model instead of Sonnet.
- `rescue`: use for substantial task handoff, debugging, implementation help,
  or follow-up work. Prefer `--background`. It is read-only unless `--write`
  is explicit.
- `monitor`: use after a background advise or rescue job to poll Claude logs
  and active agent state. Default to `--interval-ms 30000`. Prefer the human
  summary unless the user asks for raw JSON; it reports active/stale state, the
  last meaningful output line, and the suggested next action.
- `review`: use for ordinary read-only review of local git state.
- `adversarial-review`: use for challenge reviews, plan attacks, and harness
  checker passes.
- `status`, `result`, `cancel`: use for managed Claude jobs only.
- `resume-candidate`: use before follow-up work when the user did not provide a
  job id and the request sounds like "continue", "resume", or "dig deeper".

For long-running work, prefer:

```bash
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" advise --background "<question>"
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" do --background --model sonnet "<prepared task>"
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" do --background --model opus "<prepared task>"
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" rescue --background "<task>"
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" monitor <job-id> --interval-ms 30000
```

For a vague request like "check with Claude", ask a short clarification unless
the user clearly wants setup/readiness. If they want setup/readiness, run
`setup`. If they want Claude to inspect a plan, diff, or question, run `advise`
with a concrete prompt. Use `--background` for anything likely to take more
than one short answer. If a foreground `advise` or `rescue` times out, the
companion automatically launches one background job; monitor that job instead
of retrying the same prompt.

## Prepared Sonnet Tasks

Use `$claude do --model sonnet` only when the user asks for Claude/Sonnet or
agrees to use it for a concrete task. The task must be prepared through
`tasks-for-sonnet` before launching Claude.

Good Sonnet roles:

- Scout or mapper: read a bounded area and return file:line citations.
- Verifier: read absolute paths or a pinned commit and return PASS/FAIL.
- Single-concern reviewer: inspect one concern only.
- Synthesis worker: digest many small inputs into one bounded summary.
- Fully templated coding or scaffolding: only when the invariant, files, and
  verification command are explicit.

Do not use Sonnet for application code that needs judgment, broad business
logic, auth, money, migrations, PII, provider boundaries, or any task where the
task says only "use X correctly." Codex remains the brain.

Every prepared task must include:

```text
Role: <scout | verifier | reviewer | synthesis | hands>
Word cap: <400-600 words unless coding output requires otherwise>
Targets: <absolute paths and/or pinned commit>
What Must Be True:
- <falsifiable invariant>
Known Constraints:
- <repo rules, trigger citations, permissions, dependency limits>
Mechanical Verification:
- <exact command, grep, browser check, or PASS/FAIL condition>
Stop Conditions:
- <when Claude must stop and report instead of guessing>
```

Route read-only exploration through:

```bash
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" do --background --model sonnet --effort xhigh "<prepared task>"
```

Route explicit coding work only after the user agrees to write-capable Claude:

```bash
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" do --background --write --model sonnet --effort xhigh "<prepared task>"
```

## Prepared Opus Tasks

Use `$claude do --model opus` when the user asks Claude to do a complex task
and Sonnet is the wrong executor. Opus is the backup for work that needs the
same level of judgment you would reserve for GPT-5.5 or the strongest available
reasoning model.

Use Opus for:

- ambiguous debugging where the failure source is unknown
- broad multi-file refactors or architecture changes
- auth, money, migrations, PII, provider reliability, or AI runtime paths
- tasks where the "how" needs judgment, not only execution against invariants
- recovery work where Codex needs a strong second agent, not junior hands

Still prepare a specific task before launching Opus. Include the goal, relevant
absolute paths, constraints, allowed write scope, verification command, and stop
conditions. Use `--write` only after the user agrees to write-capable Claude.

```bash
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" do --background --model opus --effort xhigh "<prepared task>"
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" do --background --write --model opus --effort xhigh "<prepared task>"
```

## Commands

When invoked, map the user request to one companion call:

```bash
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" <subcommand> <args>
```

Examples:

```bash
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" setup --json
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" adversarial-review --base main --json
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" advise --background --effort xhigh "<question>"
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" do --background --model sonnet --effort xhigh "<prepared task>"
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" do --background --model opus --effort xhigh "<prepared task>"
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" monitor <job-id> --interval-ms 30000 --stale-after-ms 120000
node "<plugin root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" status --json
```
